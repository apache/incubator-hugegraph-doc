# HugeGraph RESTful API

LLMS index: [llms.txt](/llms.txt)

---

> ⚠️ **Version compatibility notes**
>
> - Current graph resource paths begin with `/graphspaces/{graphspace}/graphs/{graph}`.
> - HugeGraph 1.5.x and earlier use `/graphs/{graph}`. The request formats of APIs such as graph creation and cloning also differ from the current version.
> - The default graph space is `DEFAULT`.
> - See the [HugeGraph 1.5.x RESTful API documentation](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph-doc/tree/release-1.5.0) for older versions.
