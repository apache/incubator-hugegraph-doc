### 10.1 User Authentication and Access Control

> To enable authentication and related configurations, please refer to the [Authentication Configuration](/docs/config/config-authentication/) documentation.

##### Overview of User Authentication and Access Control:
HugeGraph supports multi-user authentication and fine-grained access control. It adopts a 4-tier design based on "User-User Group-Operation-Resource" to flexibly control user roles and permissions. Resources describe data in the graph database, such as vertices that meet certain conditions. Each resource consists of three elements: type, label, and properties. There are a total of 18 types and combinations of any label and properties to form resources. The internal condition of a resource is an "AND" relationship, while the condition between multiple resources is an "OR" relationship. Users can belong to one or more user groups, and each user group can have permissions for any number of resources. The types of operations include read, write, delete, execute, etc. HugeGraph supports dynamically creating users, user groups, and resources, and supports dynamically assigning or revoking permissions. During the initialization of the database, a super administrator user is created, and subsequently, various role users can be created by the super administrator. If a newly created user is assigned sufficient permissions, they can create or manage more users.

##### Example:

```plain
user(name=boss) -belong-> group(name=all) -access(read)-> target(graph=graph1, resource={label: person, city: Beijing})  
Description: User 'boss' has read permission for people in the 'graph1' graph from Beijing.
```

##### Interface Description:
The user authentication and access control interface includes 5 categories: UserAPI, GroupAPI, TargetAPI, BelongAPI, AccessAPI.

### 10.4 Resource (Target) API
Resources describe data in the graph database, such as vertices that meet certain criteria. Each resource includes three elements: type, label, and properties. There are 18 types in total, and the combination of any label and any properties forms a resource. The internal conditions of a resource are based on the AND relationship, while the conditions between multiple resources are based on the OR relationship.  
The resource API includes creating, deleting, modifying, and querying resources.

#### 10.4.1 Create Resource

##### Params
- target_name: Name of the resource
- target_graph: Graph of the resource
- target_url: URL of the resource
- target_resources: Resource definitions (list)

target_resources can include multiple target_resource, stored in the form of a list.  
Each target_resource contains:
- type: Optional value: VERTEX, EDGE, etc. Can be filled with ALL, indicating it can be a vertex or edge.
- label: Optional value: name of a vertex or edge type. Can be filled with *, indicating any type.
- properties: Map type, can contain multiple key-value pairs of properties. Must match all property values. Property values can support conditional ranges (e.g., age: P.gte(18)). If properties are null, it means any property is allowed. If both the property name and value are '*', it also means any property is allowed.

```plain
For example, a specific resource: "target_resources": [{"type":"VERTEX","label":"person","properties":{"city":"Beijing","age":"P.gte(20)"}}]  
The resource definition means: a vertex of type 'person' with the city property set to 'Beijing' and the age property greater than or equal to 20.
