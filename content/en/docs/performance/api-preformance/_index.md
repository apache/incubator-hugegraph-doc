The HugeGraph API performance test mainly tests HugeGraph-Server's ability to concurrently process RESTful API requests, including:

- Single insertion of vertices/edges
- Batch insertion of vertices/edges
- Vertex/Edge Queries

For the performance test of the RESTful API of each release version of HugeGraph, please refer to:

- [v0.5.6 stand-alone](/docs/performance/api-preformance/hugegraph-api-0.5.6-rocksdb/)
- [v0.5.6 cluster](/docs/performance/api-preformance/hugegraph-api-0.5.6-cassandra/)

> Updates coming soon, stay tuned!
