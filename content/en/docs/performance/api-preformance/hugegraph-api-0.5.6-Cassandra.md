### 1 Test environment

Compressed machine information

CPU                                          | Memory | 网卡      | 磁盘
-------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------
48 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz | 128G   | 10000Mbps | 750GB SSD,2.7T HDD

- Starting Pressure Machine Information: Configured the same as the compressed machine.
- Testing tool: Apache JMeter 2.5.1.

Note: The machine used to initiate the load and the machine being tested are located in the same data center (or server room)

### 2 Test Description

#### 2.1 Definition of terms (the unit of time is ms)

- Samples -- The total number of threads completed in this scenario.
- Average -- The average response time.
- Median -- The median response time in statistical terms.
- 90% Line -- The response time below which 90% of all threads fall.
- Min -- The minimum response time.
- Max -- The maximum response time.
- Error -- The error rate.
- Throughput -- The number of transactions processed per unit of time.
- KB/sec -- The throughput measured in terms of data transmitted per second.

#### 2.2 Low-Level Storage

A 15-node Cassandra cluster is used for backend storage. HugeGraph and the Cassandra cluster are located on separate servers. Server-related configuration files are modified only for host and port settings, while the rest remain default.

### 3 Summary of Performance Results

1. The speed of single vertex and edge insertion in HugeGraph is 9000 and 4500 per second, respectively.
2. The speed of bulk vertex and edge insertion is 50,000 and 150,000 per second, respectively, which is much higher than the single insertion speed.
3. The concurrency for querying vertices and edges by ID can reach more than 12,000, and the average request delay is less than 70ms.

### 4 Test Results and Analysis

#### 4.1 Batch Insertion

##### 4.1.1 Pressure Upper Limit Test

###### Test Method

###### Conclusion:

- At a concurrency level of 1000, the throughput of edges is 323, and the amount of data processed per second is 161,500 (323 * 500).

#### 4.2 Single Insertion

##### 4.2.1 Pressure Upper Limit Test

###### Test Method

###### Pressure Parameters

- Duration: 5 minutes.
- Service exception mark: Error rate greater than 0.00%.

###### Single Insertion of Vertices:

</center>

###### Conclusion:

- At a concurrency level of 9000, the throughput is 8400, and the single-insertion concurrency capability for vertices is 9000.

###### Single Insertion of Edges:

###### Conclusion:

- At a concurrency level of 4500, the throughput is 4160, and the single-insertion concurrency capability for edges is 4500.

#### 4.3 Query by ID

##### 4.3.1 Pressure Upper Limit Test

###### Test Method

Continuously increase the concurrency and test the upper limit of the pressure that the server can still provide services normally.

###### Pressure Parameters

- Duration: 5 minutes
- Service exception flag: error rate greater than 0.00%

###### Query by ID for vertices

###### Conclusion:

- The concurrent capacity of the vertex search by ID is 14500, with a throughput of 13576 and an average delay of 11ms.

###### Edge search by ID
