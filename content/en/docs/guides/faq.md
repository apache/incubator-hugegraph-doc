- How to choose the back-end storage? Choose RocksDB or Cassandra or Hbase or Mysql?

  Judge according to your specific needs. Generally, if the stand-alone machine or the data volume is < 10 billion, RocksDB is recommended, and other back-end clusters that use distributed storage are recommended.

- Prompt when starting the service: `xxx (core dumped) xxx`

  Please check if the JDK version is Java 11, at least Java 8 is required

- The service is started successfully, but there is a prompt similar to "Unable to connect to the backend or the connection is not open" when operating the graph

  init-storeBefore starting the service for the first time, you need to use the initialization backend first , and subsequent versions will prompt more clearly and directly.
  
- Do all backends need to be executed before use init-store, and can the serialization options be filled in at will?

  Except memorynot required, other backends are required, such as: `cassandra`, `hbaseand`, `rocksdb`, etc. Serialization needs to be one-to-one correspondence and cannot be filled in at will.

- Execution `init-store` error: ```Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/librocksdbjni3226083071221514754.so: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.10' not found (required by /tmp/librocksdbjni3226083071221514754.so)```

  RocksDB requires gcc 4.3.0 (GLIBCXX_3.4.10) and above

- The error `NoHostAvailableException` occurred while executing `init-store.sh`.

  `NoHostAvailableException` means that the `Cassandra` service cannot be connected to. If you are sure that you want to use the Cassandra backend, please install and start this service first. As for the message itself, it may not be clear enough, and we will update the documentation to provide further explanation.
  
- The `bin` directory contains `start-hugegraph.sh`, `start-restserver.sh` and `start-gremlinserver.sh`.  These scripts seem to be related to startup.  Which one should be used?

  Since version 0.3.3, GremlinServer and RestServer have been merged into HugeGraphServer. To start, use start-hugegraph.sh. The latter two will be removed in future versions.

- Two graphs are configured, the names are `hugegraph` and `hugegraph1`, and the command to start the service is `start-hugegraph.sh`. Is only the hugegraph graph opened?

  `start-hugegraph.sh` will open all graphs under the graphs of `gremlin-server.yaml`.  The two have no direct relationship in name

- After the service starts successfully, garbled characters are returned when using `curl` to query all vertices

  The batch vertices/edges returned by the server are compressed (gzip), and can be redirected to `gunzip` for decompression (`curl http://example | gunzip`), or can be sent with the `postman` of `Firefox` or the `restlet` plug-in of Chrome browser. request, the response data will be decompressed automatically.
  
- When using the vertex Id to query the vertex through the `RESTful API`, it returns empty, but the vertex does exist

  Check the type of the vertex ID. If it is a string type, the "id" part of the API URL needs to be enclosed in double quotes, while for numeric types, it is not necessary to enclose the ID in quotes.

- Vertex Id has been double quoted as required, but querying the vertex via the   RESTful API  still returns empty
  
  Check whether the vertex id contains `+`, `space`, `/`, `?`, `%`, `&`, and `=` reserved characters of these `URLs`.  If they exist, they need to be encoded. The following table gives the coded values:
  
  ```
  special character | encoded value
  ------------------| -------------
  +                 | %2B
  space             | %20
  /                 | %2F
  ?                 | %3F
  %                 | %25
  #                 | %23
  &                 | %26
  =                 | %3D
  ```
  
- Timeout when querying vertices or edges of a certain category (`query by label`)

  Since the amount of data belonging to a certain label may be relatively large, please add a limit limit.

- It is possible to operate the graph through the `RESTful API`, but when sending `Gremlin` statements, an error is reported: `Request Failed(500)`

  It may be that the configuration of `GremlinServer` is wrong, check whether the `host` and `port` of `gremlin-server.yaml` match the `gremlinserver.url` of `rest-server.properties`, if they do not match, modify them, and then Restart the service.

- When using `Loader` to import data, a `Socket Timeout` exception occurs, and then `Loader` is interrupted

  Continuously importing data will put too much pressure on the `Server`, which will cause some requests to time out. The pressure on `Server` can be appropriately relieved by adjusting the parameters of `Loader` (such as: number of retries, retry interval, error tolerance, etc.), and reduce the frequency of this problem.

- How to delete all vertices and edges. There is no such interface in the RESTful API. Calling `g.V().drop()` of `gremlin` will report an error `Vertices in transaction have reached capacity xxx`

  At present, there is really no good way to delete all the data. If the user deploys the `Server` and the backend by himself, he can directly clear the database and restart the `Server`. You can use the paging API or scan API to get all the data first, and then delete them one by one.

- The database has been cleared and `init-store` has been executed, but when trying to add a schema, the prompt "xxx has existed" appeared.

  There is a cache in the `HugeGraphServer`, and it is necessary to restart the `Server` when the database is cleared, otherwise the residual cache will be inconsistent.

- An error is reported during the process of inserting vertices or edges: `Id max length is 128, but got xxx {yyy}` or `Big id max length is 32768, but got xxx`

  In order to ensure query performance, the current backend storage limits the length of the id column. The vertex id cannot exceed 128 bytes, the edge id cannot exceed 32768 bytes, and the index id cannot exceed 128 bytes.

- Is there support for nested attributes, and if not, are there any alternatives?

  Nested attributes are currently not supported. Alternative: Nested attributes can be taken out as individual vertices and connected with edges.

- Can an `EdgeLabel` connect multiple pairs of `VertexLabel`, such as "investment" relationship, which can be "individual" investing in "enterprise", or "enterprise" investing in "enterprise"?

  An `EdgeLabel` does not support connecting multiple pairs of `VertexLabels`, users need to split the `EdgeLabel` into finer details, such as: "personal investment", "enterprise investment".

- Prompt `HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type` when sending a request through `RestAPI`

  `Content-Type: application/json` needs to be specified in the request header
