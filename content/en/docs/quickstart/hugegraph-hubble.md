### 1 HugeGraph-Hubble Overview

HugeGraph is an analysis-oriented graph database system that supports batch operations, which fully supports [Apache TinkerPop3](https://tinkerpop.apache.org) framework and [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) graph query language. It provides a complete tool chain ecology such as export, backup, and recovery, and effectively solve the storage, query and correlation analysis needs of massive graph data. HugeGraph is widely used in the fields of risk control, insurance claims, recommendation search, public security crime crackdown, knowledge graph, network security, IT operation and maintenance of bank securities companies, and is committed to allowing more industries, organizations and users to enjoy a wider range of data comprehensive value.

**HugeGraph-Hubble** is HugeGraph's one-stop visual analysis platform. The platform covers the whole process from data modeling, to efficient data import, to real-time and offline analysis of data, and unified management of graphs, realizing the whole process wizard of graph application. It is designed to improve the user's use fluency, lower the user's use threshold, and provide a more efficient and easy-to-use user experience.

The platform mainly includes the following modules:

##### Graph Management

The graph management module realizes the unified management of multiple graphs and graph access, editing, deletion, and query by creating graph and connecting the platform and graph data.

##### Metadata Modeling

The metadata modeling module realizes the construction and management of graph models by creating attribute libraries, vertex types, edge types, and index types. The platform provides two modes, list mode and graph mode, which can display the metadata model in real time, which is more intuitive. At the same time, it also provides a metadata reuse function across graphs, which saves the tedious and repetitive creation process of the same metadata, greatly improves modeling efficiency and enhances ease of use.

##### Data Import

Data import is to convert the user's business data into the vertices and edges of the graph and insert it into the graph database. The platform provides a wizard-style visual import module. By creating import tasks, the management of import tasks and the parallel operation of multiple import tasks are realized. Improve import performance. After entering the import task, you only need to follow the platform step prompts, upload files as needed, and fill in the content to easily implement the import process of graph data. At the same time, it supports breakpoint resuming, error retry mechanism, etc., which reduces import costs and improves efficiency.

##### Graph Analysis

By inputting the graph traversal language Gremlin, high-performance general analysis of graph data can be realized, and functions such as customized multidimensional path query of vertices can be provided, and three kinds of graph result display methods are provided, including: graph form, table form, Json form, and multidimensional display. The data form meets the needs of various scenarios used by users. It provides functions such as running records and collection of common statements, realizing the traceability of graph operations, and the reuse and sharing of query input, which is fast and efficient. It supports the export of graph data, and the export format is Json format.

##### Task Management

For Gremlin tasks that need to traverse the whole graph, index creation and reconstruction and other time-consuming asynchronous tasks, the platform provides corresponding task management functions to achieve unified management and result viewing of asynchronous tasks.
