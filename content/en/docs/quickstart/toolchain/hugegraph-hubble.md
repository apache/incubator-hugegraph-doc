### 1 HugeGraph-Hubble Overview

> **Note:** The current version of Hubble has not yet added Auth/Login related interfaces and 
> standalone protection, it will be added in the next Release version (＞ 1.5). 
> Please be careful not to expose it in a public network environment or untrusted networks to 
> avoid related SEC issues (you can also use IP & port **whitelist** + HTTPS)

> **Testing Guide**: For running HugeGraph-Hubble tests locally, please refer to [HugeGraph Toolchain Local Testing Guide](/docs/guides/toolchain-local-test)

**HugeGraph-Hubble** is HugeGraph's one-stop visual analysis platform. The platform covers the whole 
process from data modeling, to efficient data import, to real-time and offline analysis of data, and 
unified management of graphs, realizing the whole process wizard of graph application. It is designed 
to improve the user's use fluency, lower the user's use threshold, and provide a more efficient and easy-to-use user experience.

The platform mainly includes the following modules:

##### Graph Management

The graph management module realizes the unified management of multiple graphs and graph access, editing, deletion, and query by creating graph and connecting the platform and graph data.

##### Metadata Modeling

The metadata modeling module realizes the construction and management of graph models by creating attribute libraries, vertex types, edge types, and index types. The platform provides two modes, list mode and graph mode, which can display the metadata model in real time, which is more intuitive. At the same time, it also provides a metadata reuse function across graphs, which saves the tedious and repetitive creation process of the same metadata, greatly improves modeling efficiency and enhances ease of use.

##### Graph Analysis

By inputting the graph traversal language Gremlin, high-performance general analysis of graph data can be realized, and functions such as customized multidimensional path query of vertices can be provided, and three kinds of graph result display methods are provided, including: graph form, table form, Json form, and multidimensional display. The data form meets the needs of various scenarios used by users. It provides functions such as running records and collection of common statements, realizing the traceability of graph operations, and the reuse and sharing of query input, which is fast and efficient. It supports the export of graph data, and the export format is JSON format.

##### Task Management

For Gremlin tasks that need to traverse the whole graph, index creation and reconstruction, 
and other time-consuming asynchronous tasks, the platform provides corresponding task management 
functions to achieve unified management and result viewing of asynchronous tasks.

##### Data Import

> "Note: The data import function is currently suitable for preliminary use. For formal data import,
> please use [hugegraph-loader](/docs/quickstart/toolchain/hugegraph-loader), which has much better performance, stability, and functionality." 

Data import is to convert the user's business data into the vertices and edges of the graph and 
insert it into the graph database. The platform provides a wizard-style visual import module. 
By creating import tasks, the management of import tasks and the parallel operation of multiple 
import tasks are realized. Improve import performance. After entering the import task, you only 
need to follow the platform step prompts, upload files as needed, and fill in the content to easily
implement the import process of graph data. At the same time, it supports breakpoint resuming, 
error retry mechanism, etc., which reduces import costs and improves efficiency.


### 2 Deploy

There are three ways to deploy `hugegraph-hubble`

- Use Docker (Convenient for Test/Dev)
- Download the Toolchain binary package
- Source code compilation

#### 2.1 Use docker (Convenient for Test/Dev)

> **Special Note**: If you are starting `hubble` with Docker, and `hubble` and the server are on the same host. When configuring the hostname for the graph on the Hubble web page, please do not directly set it to `localhost/127.0.0.1`. This will refer to the `hubble` container internally rather than the host machine, resulting in a connection failure to the server.
>
>  If `hubble` and `server` is in the same docker network, we **recommend** using the `container_name` (in our example, it is `server`) as the hostname, and `8080` as the port. Or you can use the **host IP** as the hostname, and the port is configured by the host for the server.

We can use `docker run -itd --name=hubble -p 8088:8088 hugegraph/hubble:1.5.0` to quick start [hubble](https://hub.docker.com/r/hugegraph/hubble).

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose to start `hubble`. Additionally, if `hubble` and the graph is in the same Docker network, you can access the graph using the container name of the graph, eliminating the need for the host machine's IP address.

Use `docker-compose up -d`，`docker-compose.yml` is following:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  server:
    image: hugegraph/hugegraph:1.5.0
    container_name: server
    environment:
      - PASSWORD=xxx
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  hubble:
    image: hugegraph/hubble:1.5.0
    container_name: hubble
    ports:
      - 8088:8088
```

> Note: 
>
> 1. The docker image of hugegraph-hubble is a convenience release to start hugegraph-hubble quickly, but not **official distribution** artifacts. You can find more details from [ASF Release Distribution Policy](https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html#dockerhub).
> 
> 2. Recommend to use `release tag`(like `1.5.0`) for the stable version. Use `latest` tag to experience the newest functions in development.

#### 2.2 Download the Toolchain binary package

`hubble` is in the `toolchain` project. First, download the binary tar tarball

```bash
wget https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/hugegraph/{version}/apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-{version}.tar.gz
tar -xvf apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-{version}.tar.gz 
cd apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-{version}.tar.gz/apache-hugegraph-hubble-incubating-{version}
```

Run `hubble`

```bash
bin/start-hubble.sh
```

Then, we can see:

```shell
starting HugeGraphHubble ..............timed out with http status 502
2023-08-30 20:38:34 [main] [INFO ] o.a.h.HugeGraphHubble [] - Starting HugeGraphHubble v1.0.0 on cpu05 with PID xxx (~/apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-1.0.0/apache-hugegraph-hubble-incubating-1.0.0/lib/hubble-be-1.0.0.jar started by $USER in ~/apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-1.0.0/apache-hugegraph-hubble-incubating-1.0.0)
...
2023-08-30 20:38:38 [main] [INFO ] c.z.h.HikariDataSource [] - hugegraph-hubble-HikariCP - Start completed.
2023-08-30 20:38:41 [main] [INFO ] o.a.c.h.Http11NioProtocol [] - Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-nio-0.0.0.0-8088"]
2023-08-30 20:38:41 [main] [INFO ] o.a.h.HugeGraphHubble [] - Started HugeGraphHubble in 7.379 seconds (JVM running for 8.499)
```

Then use a web browser to access `ip:8088` and you can see the `Hubble` page. You can stop the service using bin/stop-hubble.sh.

#### 2.3 Source code compilation

**Note**: The plugin `frontend-maven-plugin` has been added to `hugegraph-hubble/hubble-be/pom.xml`. To compile hubble, you do not need to install `Nodejs V16.x` and `yarn` environment in your local environment in advance. You can directly execute the following steps.

Download the toolchain source code.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/hugegraph-toolchain.git
```

Compile `hubble`. It depends on the loader and client, so you need to build these dependencies in advance during the compilation process (you can skip this step later).

```shell
cd hugegraph-toolchain
sudo pip install -r hugegraph-hubble/hubble-dist/assembly/travis/requirements.txt
mvn install -pl hugegraph-client,hugegraph-loader -am -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -ntp
cd hugegraph-hubble
mvn -e compile package -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true -ntp
cd apache-hugegraph-hubble-incubating*
```

Run `hubble`

```bash
bin/start-hubble.sh -d
```

- Expand: Click to display the vertices associated with the selected point.
- Query: By selecting the edge type and edge direction associated with the selected point, and then selecting its attributes and corresponding filtering rules under this condition, a customized path display can be realized.
- Hide: When clicked, hides the selected point and its associated edges.

Double-clicking a vertex also displays the vertex associated with the selected point.
