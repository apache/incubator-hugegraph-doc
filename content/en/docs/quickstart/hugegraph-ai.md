## 1 HugeGraph-AI Overview
hugegraph-ai aims to explore the integration of HugeGraph and artificial intelligence (AI), including applications combined 
with large models, integration with graph machine learning components, etc., to provide comprehensive support for developers to use HugeGraph's AI capabilities in projects.

## 2 Environment Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (better to use `3.10`)  
- HugeGraph Server 1.3+

## 3. Preparation

### 3.1 Docker

**Docker Deployment**  
   Alternatively, you can deploy HugeGraph-AI using Docker:
   - Ensure you have Docker installed
   - We provide two container images:
     - **Image 1**: [hugegraph/rag](https://hub.docker.com/r/hugegraph/rag/tags)  
       For building and running the RAG functionality, suitable for quick deployment and development
     - **Image 2**: [hugegraph/rag-bin](https://hub.docker.com/r/hugegraph/rag-bin/tags)  
       Binary version compiled with Nuitka for more stable and efficient performance in production
   - Pull the Docker images:
     ```bash
     docker pull hugegraph/rag:latest # Pull Image 1
     docker pull hugegraph/rag-bin:latest # Pull Image 2
     ```
   - Start the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run -it --name rag -p 8001:8001 hugegraph/rag bash
     docker run -it --name rag-bin -p 8001:8001 hugegraph/rag-bin bash
     ```
   - Start the Graph RAG demo:
     ```bash
     # For Image 1
     python ./src/hugegraph_llm/demo/rag_demo/app.py # or run python -m hugegraph_llm.demo.rag_demo.app

     # For Image 2
     ./app.dist/app.bin
     ```
   - Access the interface at http://localhost:8001

### 3.2 Build from Source

1. Start the HugeGraph database, you can run it via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/hugegraph/hugegraph)/[Binary Package](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/download/download/).  
    Refer to detailed [doc](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-server/#31-use-docker-container-convenient-for-testdev) for more guidance

2. Configuring the uv environment, Use the official installer to install uv, See the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/installer/) for other installation methods   
    ```bash
    # You could try pipx or pip to install uv when meet network issues, refer the uv doc for more details
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  - # install the latest version like 0.7.3+
    ```

3. Clone the project
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-ai.git
    ```

4. Configuration dependency environment
    ```bash
    cd incubator-hugegraph-ai/hugegraph-llm
    uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -e .
    ```  
    If dependency download fails or too slow due to network issues, it is recommended to modify `hugegraph-llm/pyproject.toml`.

5. Start the gradio interactive demo of **Graph RAG**, you can run with the following command and open http://127.0.0.1:8001 after starting
    ```bash
    python -m hugegraph_llm.demo.rag_demo.app  # same as "uv run xxx"
    ```
    The default host is `0.0.0.0` and the port is `8001`. You can change them by passing command line arguments`--host` and `--port`.  
    ```bash
    python -m hugegraph_llm.demo.rag_demo.app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18001
    ```
   
6. After running the web demo, the config file `.env` will be automatically generated at the path `hugegraph-llm/.env`.    Additionally, a prompt-related configuration file `config_prompt.yaml` will also be generated at the path `hugegraph-llm/src/hugegraph_llm/resources/demo/config_prompt.yaml`.
    You can modify the content on the web page, and it will be automatically saved to the configuration file after the corresponding feature is triggered.  You can also modify the file directly without restarting the web application; refresh the page to load your latest changes.  
    (Optional)To regenerate the config file, you can use `config.generate` with `-u` or `--update`.  
    ```bash
    python -m hugegraph_llm.config.generate --update
    ```
    Note: `Litellm` support multi-LLM provider, refer [litellm.ai](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) to config it
7. (__Optional__) You could use 
    [hugegraph-hubble](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-hubble/#21-use-docker-convenient-for-testdev) 
    to visit the graph data, could run it via [Docker/Docker-Compose](https://hub.docker.com/r/hugegraph/hubble) 
    for guidance. (Hubble is a graph-analysis dashboard that includes data loading/schema management/graph traverser/display).
8. (__Optional__) offline download NLTK stopwords  
    ```bash
    python ./hugegraph_llm/operators/common_op/nltk_helper.py
    ```
> [!TIP]   
> You can also refer to our [quick-start](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph-ai/blob/main/hugegraph-llm/quick_start.md) doc to understand how to use it & the basic query logic 🚧

#### 4.1.2 Build a knowledge graph through code

The `KgBuilder` class is used to construct a knowledge graph. Here is a brief usage guide:

1. **Initialization**: The `KgBuilder` class is initialized with an instance of a language model. 
This can be obtained from the `LLMs` class.  
    Initialize the LLMs instance, get the LLM, and then create a task instance `KgBuilder` for graph construction. `KgBuilder` defines multiple operators, and users can freely combine them according to their needs. (tip: `print_result()` can print the result of each step in the console, without affecting the overall execution logic)

    ```python
    from hugegraph_llm.models.llms.init_llm import LLMs
    from hugegraph_llm.operators.kg_construction_task import KgBuilder
    
    TEXT = ""
    builder = KgBuilder(LLMs().get_chat_llm())
    (
        builder
        .import_schema(from_hugegraph="talent_graph").print_result()
        .chunk_split(TEXT).print_result()
        .extract_info(extract_type="property_graph").print_result()
        .commit_to_hugegraph()
        .run()
    )
    ```
    ![gradio-config](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/images/kg-uml.png)
2. **Import Schema**: The `import_schema` method is used to import a schema from a source. The source can be a HugeGraph instance, a user-defined schema, or an extraction result. The method `print_result` can be chained to print the result.
    ```python
    # Import schema from a HugeGraph instance
    builder.import_schema(from_hugegraph="xxx").print_result()
    # Import schema from an extraction result
    builder.import_schema(from_extraction="xxx").print_result()
    # Import schema from user-defined schema
    builder.import_schema(from_user_defined="xxx").print_result()
    ```
3. **Chunk Split**: The `chunk_split` method is used to split the input text into chunks. The text should be passed as a string argument to the method.
    ```python
    # Split the input text into documents
    builder.chunk_split(TEXT, split_type="document").print_result()
    # Split the input text into paragraphs
    builder.chunk_split(TEXT, split_type="paragraph").print_result()
    # Split the input text into sentences
    builder.chunk_split(TEXT, split_type="sentence").print_result()
    ```
4. **Extract Info**: The `extract_info` method is used to extract info from a text. The text should be passed as a string argument to the method.
    ```python
    TEXT = "Meet Sarah, a 30-year-old attorney, and her roommate, James, whom she's shared a home with since 2010."
    # extract property graph from the input text
    builder.extract_info(extract_type="property_graph").print_result()
    # extract triples from the input text
    builder.extract_info(extract_type="property_graph").print_result()
    ```
5. **Commit to HugeGraph**: The `commit_to_hugegraph` method is used to commit the constructed knowledge graph to a HugeGraph instance.
    ```python
    builder.commit_to_hugegraph().print_result()
    ```
6. **Run**: The `run` method is used to execute the chained operations.
    ```python
    builder.run()
    ```
    The methods of the `KgBuilder` class can be chained together to perform a sequence of operations.

### 4.2 Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based on HugeGraph

The `RAGPipeline` class is used to integrate HugeGraph with large language models to provide retrieval-augmented generation capabilities.
Here is a brief usage guide:

1. **Extract Keyword**: Extract keywords and expand synonyms.
    ```python
    from hugegraph_llm.operators.graph_rag_task import RAGPipeline
    graph_rag = RAGPipeline()
    graph_rag.extract_keywords(text="Tell me about Al Pacino.").print_result()
    ```
2. **Match Vid from Keywords**: Match the nodes with the keywords in the graph.
    ```python
    graph_rag.keywords_to_vid().print_result()
    ```
3. **Query Graph for Rag**: Retrieve the corresponding keywords and their multi-degree associated relationships from HugeGraph.
     ```python
     graph_rag.query_graphdb(max_deep=2, max_graph_items=30).print_result()
     ```
4. **Rerank Searched Result**: Rerank the searched results based on the similarity between the question and the results.
     ```python
     graph_rag.merge_dedup_rerank().print_result()
     ```
5. **Synthesize Answer**: Summarize the results and organize the language to answer the question.
    ```python
    graph_rag.synthesize_answer(vector_only_answer=False, graph_only_answer=True).print_result()
    ```
6. **Run**: The `run` method is used to execute the above operations.
    ```python
    graph_rag.run(verbose=True)
    ```
