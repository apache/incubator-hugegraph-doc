### 1 HugeGraph-Store Overview

HugeGraph-Store is the storage node component of HugeGraph's distributed version, responsible for actually storing and managing graph data. It works in conjunction with HugeGraph-PD to form HugeGraph's distributed storage engine, providing high availability and horizontal scalability.

### 2 Prerequisites

#### 2.1 Requirements

- Operating System: Linux or MacOS (Windows has not been fully tested)
- Java version: ≥ 11
- Maven version: ≥ 3.5.0
- Deployed HugeGraph-PD (for multi-node deployment)

### 3 Deployment

There are two ways to deploy the HugeGraph-Store component:

- Method 1: Download the tar package
- Method 2: Compile from source

#### 3.1 Download the tar package

Download the latest version of HugeGraph-Store from the Apache HugeGraph official download page:

```bash
# Replace {version} with the latest version number, e.g., 1.5.0
wget https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/hugegraph/{version}/apache-hugegraph-incubating-{version}.tar.gz  
tar zxf apache-hugegraph-incubating-{version}.tar.gz
cd apache-hugegraph-incubating-{version}/apache-hugegraph-hstore-incubating-{version}
```

#### 3.2 Compile from source

```bash
# 1. Clone the source code
git clone https://github.com/apache/hugegraph.git

# 2. Build the project
cd hugegraph
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

# 3. After successful compilation, the Store module build artifacts will be located at
#    apache-hugegraph-incubating-{version}/apache-hugegraph-hstore-incubating-{version}
#    target/apache-hugegraph-incubating-{version}.tar.gz
```

### 4 Configuration

The main configuration file for Store is `conf/application.yml`. Here are the key configuration items:

```yaml
pdserver:
  # PD service address, multiple PD addresses are separated by commas (configure PD's gRPC port)
  address: 127.0.0.1:8686

grpc:
  # gRPC service address
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8500
  netty-server:
    max-inbound-message-size: 1000MB

raft:
  # raft cache queue size
  disruptorBufferSize: 1024
  address: 127.0.0.1:8510
  max-log-file-size: 600000000000
  # Snapshot generation time interval, in seconds
  snapshotInterval: 1800

server:
  # REST service address
  port: 8520

app:
  # Storage path, supports multiple paths separated by commas
  data-path: ./storage
  #raft-path: ./storage

spring:
  application:
    name: store-node-grpc-server
  profiles:
    active: default
    include: pd

logging:
  config: 'file:./conf/log4j2.xml'
  level:
    root: info
```

For multi-node deployment, you need to modify the following configurations for each Store node:

1. `grpc.port` (RPC port) for each node
2. `raft.address` (Raft protocol port) for each node
3. `server.port` (REST port) for each node
4. `app.data-path` (data storage path) for each node

### 5 Start and Stop

#### 5.1 Start Store

Ensure that the PD service is already started, then in the Store installation directory, execute:

```bash
./bin/start-hugegraph-store.sh
```

After successful startup, you can see logs similar to the following in `logs/hugegraph-store-server.log`:

```
2024-xx-xx xx:xx:xx [main] [INFO] o.a.h.s.n.StoreNodeApplication - Started StoreNodeApplication in x.xxx seconds (JVM running for x.xxx)
```

#### 5.2 Stop Store

In the Store installation directory, execute:

```bash
./bin/stop-hugegraph-store.sh
```

### 6 Multi-Node Deployment Example

Below is a configuration example for a three-node deployment:

#### 6.1 Three-Node Configuration Reference

- 3 PD nodes
  - raft ports: 8610, 8611, 8612
  - rpc ports: 8686, 8687, 8688
  - rest ports: 8620, 8621, 8622
- 3 Store nodes
  - raft ports: 8510, 8511, 8512
  - rpc ports: 8500, 8501, 8502
  - rest ports: 8520, 8521, 8522

#### 6.2 Store Node Configuration

For the three Store nodes, the main configuration differences are as follows:

Node A:
```yaml
grpc:
  port: 8500
raft:
  address: 127.0.0.1:8510
server:
  port: 8520
app:
  data-path: ./storage-a
```

Node B:
```yaml
grpc:
  port: 8501
raft:
  address: 127.0.0.1:8511
server:
  port: 8521
app:
  data-path: ./storage-b
```

Node C:
```yaml
grpc:
  port: 8502
raft:
  address: 127.0.0.1:8512
server:
  port: 8522
app:
  data-path: ./storage-c
```

All nodes should point to the same PD cluster:
```yaml
pdserver:
  address: 127.0.0.1:8686,127.0.0.1:8687,127.0.0.1:8688
```

### 7 Verify Store Service

Confirm that the Store service is running properly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8520/actuator/health
```

If it returns `{"status":"UP"}`, it indicates that the Store service has been successfully started.

Additionally, you can check the status of Store nodes in the cluster through the PD API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8620/pd/api/v1/stores
```
