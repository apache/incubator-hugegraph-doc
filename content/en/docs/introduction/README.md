### Summary

Apache HugeGraph is an easy-to-use, efficient, general-purpose open-source graph database system
(Graph Database, [GitHub project address](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph)), implementing the [Apache TinkerPop3](https://tinkerpop.apache.org) framework and fully compatible with the [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) query language,
while also supporting the [Cypher](https://opencypher.org/) query language (OpenCypher standard).
With complete toolchain components, it helps users easily build applications and products based on graph databases. HugeGraph supports fast import of more than 10 billion vertices and edges, and provides millisecond-level relational query capability (OLTP).
It also supports large-scale distributed graph computing (OLAP).

Typical application scenarios of HugeGraph include deep relationship exploration, association analysis, path search, feature extraction, data clustering, community detection, knowledge graph, etc., and are applicable to business fields such as network security, telecommunication fraud, financial risk control, advertising recommendation, social network, and intelligence Robots, etc.

### Features

HugeGraph supports graph operations in online and offline environments, batch importing of data and efficient complex relationship analysis. It can seamlessly be integrated with big data platforms.
HugeGraph supports multi-user parallel operations. Users can enter Gremlin/Cypher query statements and get graph query results in time. They can also call the HugeGraph API in user programs for graph analysis or queries.

This system has the following features:

- Ease of use: HugeGraph supports the Gremlin/Cypher graph query languages and a RESTful API, providing common interfaces for graph retrieval, and peripheral tools with complete functions to easily implement various graph-based query and analysis operations.
- Efficiency: HugeGraph has been deeply optimized in graph storage and graph computing, and provides a variety of batch import tools, which can easily complete the rapid import of tens of billions of data, and achieve millisecond-level response for graph retrieval through optimized queries. Supports simultaneous online real-time operations of thousands of users.
- Universal: HugeGraph supports the Apache Gremlin standard graph query language and the Property Graph standard graph modeling method, and supports graph-based OLTP and OLAP schemes. Integrate Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark big data platforms.
- Scalable: supports distributed storage, multiple copies of data, and horizontal expansion, built-in multiple back-end storage engines, and can easily expand the back-end storage engine through plug-ins.
- Open: HugeGraph code is open source (Apache 2 License), customers can modify and customize independently, and selectively give back to the open-source community.

### Deployment Modes

HugeGraph supports multiple deployment modes to meet different scales and scenarios:

**Standalone Mode**
- Server + RocksDB backend storage
- Suitable for development, testing, and small-to-medium scale data (< 4TB)
- Docker quick start: `docker run hugegraph/hugegraph`
- See [Server Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/hugegraph/hugegraph-server)

**Distributed Mode**
- HugeGraph-PD: Metadata management and cluster scheduling
- HugeGraph-Store (HStore): Distributed storage engine
- Supports horizontal scaling and high availability (< 1000TB data scale)
- Suitable for production environments and large-scale graph data applications

### Quick Start Guide

| Use Case | Recommended Path |
|---------|---------|
| Quick experience | [Docker deployment](/docs/quickstart/hugegraph/hugegraph-server#docker) |

| Graph analysis (OLAP) | [Vermeer](/docs/quickstart/computing/hugegraph-computer) (recommended) or Computer |
| Build AI applications | [HugeGraph-AI](/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-ai) (GraphRAG/Knowledge Graph) |
| Batch data import | [Loader](/docs/quickstart/toolchain/hugegraph-loader) + [Hubble](/docs/quickstart/toolchain/hugegraph-hubble) |

### System Functions 

- Supports batch import of data from multiple data sources (including local files, HDFS files, MySQL databases, and other data sources), and supports import of multiple file formats (including TXT, CSV, JSON, and other formats)
- With a visual operation interface, it can be used for operation, analysis, and display diagrams, reducing the threshold for users to use
- Optimized graph interface: shortest path (Shortest Path), K-step connected subgraph (K-neighbor), K-step to reach the adjacent point (K-out), personalized recommendation algorithm PersonalRank, etc.
- Implemented based on the Apache TinkerPop3 framework, supports Gremlin graph query language
- Support attribute graph, attributes can be added to vertices and edges, and support rich attribute types
- Has independent schema metadata information, has powerful graph modeling capabilities, and facilitates third-party system integration
- Support multi-vertex ID strategy: support primary key ID, support automatic ID generation, support user-defined string ID, support user-defined digital ID
- The attributes of edges and vertices can be indexed to support precise query, range query, and full-text search
- The storage system adopts a plug-in method, supporting RocksDB (standalone/cluster), Cassandra, ScyllaDB, HBase, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Palo and Memory, etc.
- Integrated with big data systems such as HDFS, Spark/Flink, GraphX, etc., supports BulkLoad operation to import massive data.
- Supports HA(high availability), multiple data replicas, backup and recovery, monitoring, distributed Trace, etc.
