### Java version statement

In 1.3.0:
1. consider using Java 11 in `hugegraph/toolchain/commons`, also compatible with Java 8 now.
2. `hugegraph-computer` required to use Java 11, **not compatible with Java 8!**
3. Using Java8 may loss some security ensured, we recommend using Java 11 in **production env** with AuthSystem enabled.

**1.3.0** is the last major version compatible with **Java 8**, compatibility with Java 8 will end in 
next release(1.5.0) when [PD/Store](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/issues/2265) merged into master branch (Except for the `java-client`).

PS: In the future, we will gradually upgrade the java version, **Java 11** -> **Java 17** -> **Java 21**.
