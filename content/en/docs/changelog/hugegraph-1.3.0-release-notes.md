### Operating Environment / Version Description

1. consider using Java 11 in `hugegraph/toolchain/commons`, also compatible with Java 8 now.
2. `hugegraph-computer` required to use Java 11, **not compatible with Java 8!**
3. Using Java8 may loss some security ensured, we recommend using Java 11 in **production env** with [AuthSystem](/docs/config/config-authentication/) enabled.

**1.3.0** is the **last major** version compatible with **Java 8**, compatibility with Java 8 will end in 
next release(1.5.0) when [PD/Store](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/issues/2265) merged into 
master branch (Except for the `java-client`).

PS: In the future, we will gradually upgrade the java version from `Java 11 -> Java 17 -> Java 21.`
