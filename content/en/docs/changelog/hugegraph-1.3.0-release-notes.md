### Java version statement
v1.3.0:
1. hugegraph, hugegraph-toolchain, hugegraph-commons consider use Java 11, also compatible with Java 8 now.
2. hugegraph-computer required to use Java 11, **not compatible with Java 8 now!**

**v1.3.0 may be the last major version compatible with Java 8**, compatibility with Java 8 will totally end in v1.5 when [PD/Store](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/issues/2265) merged into master branch (Except for the `java-client`).

In the future, we will gradually upgrade the java version, **Java 11** -> **Java 17** -> **Java 21**.
