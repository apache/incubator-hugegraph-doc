{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-shipping-fast" title="Efficient" %}}
Has been deeply optimized in graph storage and graph computation. It provides multiple batch import tools that can easily complete the fast-import of tens of billions of data, achieves millisecond-level response for graph retrieval through ameliorated queries, and supports concurrent online and real-time operations for thousands of users.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-exchange-alt" title="Adaptable" %}}
Adapts to the Apache Gremlin standard graph query language and the Property Graph standard modeling method, and both support graph-based OLTP and OLAP schemes. Furthermore, HugeGraph can be integrated with Hadoop and Spark's big data platforms, and easily extend the back-end storage engine through plug-ins.
