<p>HugeGraph supports fast import performance in the case of more than 10 billion Vertices and Edges</p>
<p> Graph,millisecond-level OLTP query capability, and large-scale distributed</p>
<p> graph processing (OLAP). The main scenarios of HugeGraph include</p>
<p> correlation search, fraud detection, and knowledge graph.</p>

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-lightbulb" title="Convenient" %}}
Not only supports Gremlin graph query language and RESTful API but also provides commonly used graph algorithm APIs. To help users easily implement various queries and analyses, HugeGraph has a full range of accessory tools, such as supporting distributed storage, data replication, scaling horizontally, and supports many built-in backends of storage engines.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-shipping-fast" title="Efficient" %}}
Has been deeply optimized in graph storage and graph computation. It provides multiple batch import tools that can easily complete the fast-import of tens of billions of data, achieves millisecond-level response for graph retrieval through ameliorated queries, and supports concurrent online and real-time operations for thousands of users.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-exchange-alt" title="Adaptable" %}}
Adapts to the Apache Gremlin standard graph query language and the Property Graph standard modeling method, and both support graph-based OLTP and OLAP schemes. Furthermore, HugeGraph can be integrated with Hadoop and Spark's big data platforms, and easily extend the back-end storage engine through plug-ins.

<p>Apache HugeGraph is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
