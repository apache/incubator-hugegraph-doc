RocksDB provides a rich set of configuration parameters, but most of them typically require hardcoded setup.

[ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb) introduces a **SidePlugin + YAML** mechanism, making configuration more modular and composable.

This document focuses on the **extended parameters of ToplingDB**, helping readers understand their purpose and usage.

## 0. rocksdb_plus.yaml used in HugeGraph

The following includes only the configuration parameters used in HugeGraph. For the full configuration supported by ToplingDB, refer to the [SidePlugin Wiki](https://github.com/topling/sideplugin-wiki-en/wiki):

    memtable_as_log_index: true # Combined with convert_to_sst: kFileMmap to enable [omit L0 Flush](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb/wiki/Omit-L0-Flush)
```

**Key points**:

- `listening_ports: '127.0.0.1:2011'` sets the Web Server listening port to 2011 and restricts access to localhost.
- `memtable_as_log_index: true` combined with `convert_to_sst: kFileMmap` enables [omit L0 Flush](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb/wiki/Omit-L0-Flush).
- `memtable_factory: "${cspp}"` specifies the memory structure as `CSPP Memtable`.
- `table_factory: dispatch` sets the TableFactory to the custom `DispatcherTable` defined in YAML.

## 1. Plugin-based configuration and reference mechanism

- **YAML modularization**: The configuration file is organized as objects; each object can be defined independently and referenced elsewhere.
- **Reference syntax**: Objects can be reused across sections via `${lru_cache}`, `${cspp}`, etc.
- **DispatcherTable**: Allows selecting different TableFactories at different levels or scenarios. RocksDB natively supports only a single TableFactory.

This mechanism makes configuration more flexible and easier to compose in complex scenarios.

## 2. New MemTable implementation: CSPP

ToplingDB provides a MemTable type that RocksDB does not natively have, configured with the following parameters:

### mem_cap

`mem_cap` is the size of the virtual address space reserved for CSPP. This may be just reserved address space without actual physical allocation.
The actual memory usage of `mem_cap` is approximately equal to `write_buffer_size`.

#### Background of mem_cap Design

The underlying algorithm of CSPP adopts a pre-allocation strategy to support high-concurrency writes.
Once the pre-allocated memory is filled, no further writes can proceed.
However, RocksDB itself lacks a mechanism that allows a memtable to actively report
"the pre-allocated memory is full, a new memtable is required".
Due to the complexity of its call chain, it is impractical to refactor RocksDB to add this capability.
Therefore, CSPP adapts to RocksDB’s behavior through parameter design.

#### Core Idea of mem_cap

ToplingDB sets `mem_cap` to be much larger than `write_buffer_size`,
so that RocksDB will not prematurely trigger an "out of memory" error when writing to a memtable.
During CSPP initialization (`New`), the system rechecks the setting.
If `mem_cap` is found to be too small, it will be automatically adjusted to `2 * write_buffer_size` to ensure stability during the write process.

The default value is 2G, and the effective maximum is 16G.

- Small deployments (<16GB RAM): set to 20–30% of system memory
- Medium deployments (16–64GB RAM): set to 8–16G
- Large deployments (>64GB RAM): set to 16G

### use_vm

When allocating memory via `malloc/posix_memalign`, the address space may already be physically allocated (heap space with mapped pages), while CSPP only needs reserved virtual address space.  
When `use_vm` is `true`, allocation is forced to use `mmap`, ensuring reserved address space without occupying physical pages.  
The default is `true`. If physical memory is sufficient, it is recommended to disable this option—establishing mappings from `mmap`’s virtual memory to physical pages can trigger many minor page faults and may affect performance.

### convert_to_sst

`convert_to_sst` supports three enum values:

- `kDontConvert`: Disables the feature (default). Uses the traditional Flush process, offering the best compatibility for stability-focused scenarios.
- `kDumpMem`: During conversion, dumps the entire MemTable memory to an SST file, reducing CPU consumption but not memory usage.
- `kFileMmap`: `mmap`s MemTable content into a file—the key feature—reduces both CPU and memory usage. You can also set `DBOptions.memtable_as_log_index = true` to essentially eliminate MemTable Flush.

These parameters offer more tunable options for the write path, allowing users to choose as needed.

For more design details, see: [cspp-memtable](https://github.com/topling/cspp-memtable/blob/memtable_as_log_index/README_EN.md), [ToplingDB CSPP MemTable Design Essentials](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/649435555), [CSPP Trie Design Analysis](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/499138254).

## 3. TableFactory extensions

- **CSPPMemTabTable**: The TableFactory paired with the `cspp` MemTable.
- **DispatcherTable**: Supports specifying different TableFactories per level, for example:
  - Use BlockBasedTable by default.
  - Use CSPPMemTabTable for specific levels.

This level of flexibility is not available in native RocksDB configuration.

## 4. Statistics and observability controls

- **discard_tickers / discard_histograms**: Precisely specify which statistics to discard.
- **stats_level: kDisableAll**: Combined with the above, flexibly control the overhead of statistics.

Compared to RocksDB’s coarse-grained controls, ToplingDB offers finer tuning.

## 5. New DBOptions parameter

- **memtable_as_log_index: true**: Allows using the MemTable as a log index to speed up recovery.

## 6. Security considerations

**Web Server security**:

- The Web Server pages are provided by ToplingDB and do not include authentication.
- By default, `listening_ports: '127.0.0.1:2011'` restricts access to local requests.
- In production, configure firewall rules to allow only intranet access.
- To disable the Web Server, set `rocksdb.open_http=false` in `hugegraph.properties`.

**Shared memory safety**:

- `document_root: /dev/shm/rocksdb_resource` uses a shared memory directory.
- In multi-user environments, ensure proper file permissions to avoid unauthorized access.

## 7. Summary

ToplingDB adds the following capabilities on top of RocksDB:

- Plugin-based configuration and object reuse
- A new MemTable type (cspp) with a paired TableFactory
- DispatcherTable for multi-factory scheduling
- Built-in Web Server
- More flexible statistics and observability controls
- Special DBOptions (such as `memtable_as_log_index`)

These extensions give users more tuning space, particularly suited for scenarios requiring high write performance and flexible operations.
