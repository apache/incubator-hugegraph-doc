        Not only supports Gremlin graph query language and RESTful
        API but also provides commonly used graph algorithm APIs. To
        help users easily implement various queries and analyses,
        HugeGraph has a full range of accessory tools, such as
        supporting distributed storage, data replication, scaling
        horizontally, and supports many built-in backends of storage
        engines.

        Has been deeply optimized in graph storage and graph
        computation. It provides multiple batch import tools that can
        easily complete the fast-import of tens of billions of data,
        achieves millisecond-level response for graph retrieval through
        ameliorated queries, and supports concurrent online and real-
        time operations for thousands of users.

        Adapts to the Apache Gremlin standard graph query language
        and the Property Graph standard modeling method, and both
        support graph-based OLTP and OLAP schemes. Furthermore,
        HugeGraph can be integrated with Hadoop and Sparkâ€™s big data
        platforms, and easily extend the back-end storage engine
        through plug-ins.
